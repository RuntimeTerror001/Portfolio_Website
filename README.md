## How It Works

This project uses a component-based structure with React. Each section (Home, About, Projects, Contact) is typically a separate component. You can customize content easily by editing text, images, and links in the relevant files.

## Customizing Your Info

Update your personal details in the relevant React component files:

Your name and headline

About description

Skills

Projects and links

Contact information

These are usually found in component files under the src/components/ folder.

(Adjust exactly where based on your structure.)
